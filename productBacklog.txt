- Create New Course
- Create New Test

- Show keyID (in base 4) to teacher somehow

- Percentages Displayed should always be display to two decimal places
- RegEx on all user input

- Logout button (only on certain Scenes?)

- Options after successful upload:
	Grade Another, Different Class/AnswerKey, Logout/Done.
	

- Remove Hard-Coded Data after Server changes (keyID on POST requests, show real student name when returned from POST request).




SERVER ISSUE?
- Doesn't immediately show New Course after it is created. Is Redis not updating until user logs out and back in?
